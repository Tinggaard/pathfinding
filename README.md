# Pathfinding algorithms
A school project on pathfinding algorithms based on mazes, by Jens Tinggaard.

## Prerequisites
Requires installation of `numpy` and `opencv-python`.

I'd recommend creating a virtual environment:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tinggaard/pathfinding.git
cd pathfinding
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```shell
python main.py [maze_file]
```
E.g.
```shell
python main.py ../in/tiny.png
```
